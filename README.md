Heliotrope was an immersive installation that explored our relationship with light. Existing in both physical and virtual spaces, it highlighted the impact of light on our health and investigate Seasonal Affective Disorder.

[Trigger](http://www.triggerstuff.co.uk) worked with a collaborative team of artists, designers and scientists including [DO Architecture](http://www.do-architecture.co.uk), sound artist [Hanna Tuulikki](http://soundcloud.com/hanna-tuulikki), psychiatrist John Eagles, designer [Stefanie Posavec](http://www.itsbeenreal.co.uk), writer [Molly Naylor](http://mollynaylor.com), and developer [Justin Quillinan](http://justinq.net).

In the summer of 2012 the team developed Heliotrope at a creative lab at the [CCA](http://www.cca-glasgow.com/home) in Glasgow. During this lab we explored concepts for an immersive light and sound-filled space, informing designs for a prototype installation at Glasgow's [Botanic Gardens](http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/residents/parks_outdoors/parks_gardens/botanicgardens.htm) in November of 2012.
