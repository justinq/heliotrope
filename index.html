        How does light affect us? How do we feel the seasons? What is our relationship with the sun? What happens to us during the winter months when we see less of it?

        Heliotrope has three parts to it: a 12 minute audio and light installation, this website and a beautiful limited edition booklet. It has been created by a team of artists, designers and scientists, working together to explore the impact of light on human minds and bodies.

          <p>
        The installation happened at the Kibble Palace in Glasgow's Botanic Gardens from 24 to 27 November 2012.

        Hanna Tuulikki's soundtrack has been created from a series of singing bowl and gong samples. In early 2012, Hanna visited sound therapist Helen Johnson who has been exploring the use of singing bowls in a therapeutic setting since the 1980s. Working with musician Daniel Padden she recorded samples of a number of differently sized bowls, as well as various gongs. She then used these to develop a twelve minute composition: an audio narrative that takes us on a journey from the darkness of winter towards the brightness of summer.
        </p>
          <p>
        The soundscape is a surround sound piece, and appears to emerge from all directions when experienced as part of Heliotrope. It will be available to listen to online in mid-November.
        </p>
          <!-- TODO: For inclusion when iteration 2 goes live.
          Some of the samples that Hanna has been working with are embedded in this website. If you close this window, you can choose to switch to the audio version of the site. This will let you 'play' the planets drifting around the Heliotrope sun. -->

        We have created this website as a parallel way of experiencing Heliotrope. It explores the same themes as the physical installation in a way that we hope is sensitive to and appropriate for online viewing.
        </p>
          <p>
        Created by Justin Quillinan and Stefanie Posavec, the website communicates seasonal shifts in mood. Appearance changes throughout the day, reflecting the way our emotional state can change in response to the seasons. If you're looking at this during daytime hours, you'll encounter a representation of summer moods: warmth, happiness, bright colours and fast movements. If it's the night wherever you are, you'll encounter a version of winter moods: darker, more subdued, cooler colours, slower movement.
        </p>
          <p>
        All through the day the mood of the website changes: from a summer day to a winter night and evolving through the spring and autumn twilight hours between.

        The Heliotrope lightscape was devised and choreographed by Adrian Stewart and Judith Wylie Macleod of <a href="http://www.do-architecture.co.uk">DO Architecture</a>. It is twelve minutes long, and reflects a journey from the darkness of winter into the bright warmth of summer. Shifting the colour temperature of white light simulates the nuance between varying seasons.
        </p>
          <p>
        Intelligent control of the luminaires permits variation of intensity and colour temperature from warm (2700K) to cool (6500K). They are normally used for architectural purposes: to light cityscapes, landscapes, buildings or bridges.

        Heliotrope began with a conversation about how much the city needs an injection of light once nights start drawing in. What happens to us when the seasons change, why do so many of us feel lethargic and withdrawn? Could we create a large sunny spot in the middle of cloudy, grey Glasgow to help us deal with our cravings for light?
        </p>
          <p>
        Producers Trigger and DO Architecture were early collaborators, with psychiatrist John Eagles providing specialist scientific support. We applied successfully to the Wellcome Trust and Creative Scotland for funding to develop the project, and brought in additional team members. Hanna Tuulikki came on board as a sound artist, Stefanie Posavec as a graphic designer, Justin Quillinan as a programmer and Tom Brown as a second psychiatrist.
        </p>
          <p>
        We issued an open call for a writer, and found Molly Naylor. Briefed to create a piece of fiction about seasonality, she worked closely with John Eagles to co-author complementary pieces of poetry and prose that explore our relationship with light. You can read these by clicking on the Writing planet.
        </p>
          <p>
        Very quickly we established circadian rhythms, the rotation of the earth and the number twelve as themes. Everything references these: the logo and design work, the timing of the piece (12 minutes long), the shape of the installation, the writing. We worked closely together as a team, learning about each others' processes and exploring collaborative ways of working that allowed us all to impact on and influence each other.
        </p>
          <p>
        We hope we've created something beautiful that reflects our own learning curves, what we now know about the seasons and how we operate within them. We hope you enjoy it.

        One day you wake up and the dog is gone.<br />Nothing pulls your arm as you walk,<br />no sticky residue left from balling fist in fur<br />and in the pub, you begin to ask<br />if the dog can come in, before remembering<br />that the dog is no longer a thing.<br /> Your hands are quicker.<br />Your t-shirts are cleaner<br />and the way you speak:<br />you mean what you say more.<br />You lose yourself in April.<br />Things look much more floral.<br />The dent at the end of your bed<br />begins flattening and your feet start forgetting.<br />You're less like a chrysalis<br />more like a moth.<br />Your voice has a flippancy that makes you feel<br />that you are fall-in-lovable.<br /> Through the lighter months you don't forget entirely<br />but the heart-sink fades<br />and the shoulder-pull feeling doesn't stay.<br />By July you don't even remember the dog's name<br />and you stop wondering when it's coming back.<br />You smile at dog walkers in the park<br />and fellow black dog owners<br />you forgot to make friends with in the dark.<br /> You vow to be nicer to them next winter<br />and you hope their dogs have left them too.<br />You feel closer to everyone as the chorus begins,<br />as you walk home the long way in the last of the night.<br />Some of us were in a darker place to begin with<br />but we are, all of us, searching for the light.<br />

        EVOLVING THROUGH THE SEASONS
        </h2>
          <p>
        Men and women have been evolving on our planet for about two million years. Adapting successfully to seasonal changes improved humans' chances of surviving and flourishing. Seasonal changes in mood and activity levels may once have been an evolutionary advantage, as they are for animals who hibernate. Energetic, out-going women and men in spring and summer would have been more likely to find a mate and reproduce. The baby of a mother who became pregnant in the summer would be born in spring when the climate and availability of food would have improved the chances of survival. Mothers who were pregnant during the autumn and winter months would have had healthier pregnancies if they ate more, slept more and were quietly &quot;depressed&quot; and inactive.

        LIGHT AND HEALTH
        </h2>
          <p>
        The idea that light and the seasons may be important to our health is not new. In 400 B.C. the Greek Physician Hippocrates wrote that &quot;it is chiefly the changes of seasons which produce diseases&quot;. In 200 A.D. another Physician named Aretaeus suggested that &quot;lethargics are to be laid in the light and exposed to the rays of the sun (for the disease is gloom)&quot;.
        </p>
          <p>
        All mammals synthesize Vitamin D through exposure to sunlight. This is essential to maintaining healthy bones. During the last 30 years, it has been appreciated that reduced light exposure can increase the risk of winter depression. At the beginning of the 20th century the vast majority of western adults worked outdoors. Now most of us work indoors. Perhaps our health has not benefitted from these changes.

        One study in North America found that 90% of people experienced changes in their well-being across the seasons of the year. It is normal to be more energetic and positive in the spring and summer - we feel &quot;bright&quot;. It is normal to slow down, to eat more and to sleep more during the winter months - we feel &quot;gloomier&quot;. For most of us, these changes are mild and tolerable. Only when these changes are extreme can they be considered as a &quot;disorder&quot; or an &quot;illness&quot;.

        Particularly for milder winter depression, anything that cuts into the winter cycles of gloom is likely to help. This might include getting more exercise, going outside in the daylight or losing weight.
        </p>
          <p>
        Light therapy, usually from a light box or a dawn simulating alarm clock, is generally helpful for more severe symptoms. A light box is often used for about 30 minutes at breakfast time.
        </p>
          <p>
        Antidepressants, again for the more severely affected, are often helpful.
        </p>
          <p>
        Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has also been shown to be therapeutic.

        The terms <em>Seasonal Affective Disorder</em> (SAD) and <em>recurrent winter depression</em> are used when people regularly experience severe lowering of mood and energy each winter.
        </p>
          <p>
        Like &quot;ordinary&quot; (non-seasonal) depression, sufferers are likely to have low mood, loss of pleasure and interest, low energy, low sex drive, irritability and social withdrawal. Unlike non-seasonal depression, with winter depression people usually eat more, gain weight and sleep more. They also have difficulty waking in the morning. About a third of people who get recurrent winter depression become overactive and over-cheerful in the spring and summer.

        Although lack of light is the major cause, other factors contribute to the continuation and worsening of winter depression. These factors can feed into each other and cause vicious circles of increasing symptoms, as shown below:
