  <p>Men and women have been evolving on our planet for about two million years. Adapting successfully to seasonal changes improved humans' chances of surviving and flourishing. Seasonal changes in mood and activity levels may once have been an evolutionary advantage, as they are for animals who hibernate. Energetic, out-going women and men in spring and summer would have been more likely to find a mate and reproduce. The baby of a mother who became pregnant in the summer would be born in spring when the climate and availability of food would have improved the chances of survival. Mothers who were pregnant during the autumn and winter months would have had healthier pregnancies if they ate more, slept more and were quietly &quot;depressed&quot; and inactive.</p>
