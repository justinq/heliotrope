## BRIGHTENING UP/ SEEING THE LIGHT

Particularly for milder winter depression, anything that cuts into the winter cycles of gloom is likely to help. This might include getting more exercise, going outside in the daylight or losing weight.

Light therapy, usually from a light box or a dawn simulating alarm clock, is generally helpful for more severe symptoms. A light box is often used for about 30 minutes at breakfast time.

Antidepressants, again for the more severely affected, are often helpful.

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has also been shown to be therapeutic.
