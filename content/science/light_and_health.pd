## LIGHT AND HEALTH

The idea that light and the seasons may be important to our health is not new. In 400 B.C. the Greek Physician Hippocrates wrote that "it is chiefly the changes of seasons which produce diseases". In 200 A.D. another Physician named Aretaeus suggested that "lethargics are to be laid in the light and exposed to the rays of the sun (for the disease is gloom)".

All mammals synthesize Vitamin D through exposure to sunlight. This is essential to maintaining healthy bones. During the last 30 years, it has been appreciated that reduced light exposure can increase the risk of winter depression. At the beginning of the 20th century the vast majority of western adults worked outdoors. Now most of us work indoors. Perhaps our health has not benefitted from these changes.
