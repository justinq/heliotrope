  <p>One study in North America found that 90% of people experienced changes in their well-being across the seasons of the year. It is normal to be more energetic and positive in the spring and summer - we feel &quot;bright&quot;. It is normal to slow down, to eat more and to sleep more during the winter months - we feel &quot;gloomier&quot;. For most of us, these changes are mild and tolerable. Only when these changes are extreme can they be considered as a &quot;disorder&quot; or an &quot;illness&quot;.</p>
