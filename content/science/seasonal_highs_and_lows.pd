## SEASONAL HIGHS AND LOWS

One study in North America found that 90% of people experienced changes in their well-being across the seasons of the year. It is normal to be more energetic and positive in the spring and summer - we feel "bright". It is normal to slow down, to eat more and to sleep more during the winter months - we feel "gloomier". For most of us, these changes are mild and tolerable. Only when these changes are extreme can they be considered as a "disorder" or an "illness".
