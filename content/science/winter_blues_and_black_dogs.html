  <p>The terms <em>Seasonal Affective Disorder</em> (SAD) and <em>recurrent winter depression</em> are used when people regularly experience severe lowering of mood and energy each winter.</p>
  <p>Like &quot;ordinary&quot; (non-seasonal) depression, sufferers are likely to have low mood, loss of pleasure and interest, low energy, low sex drive, irritability and social withdrawal. Unlike non-seasonal depression, with winter depression people usually eat more, gain weight and sleep more. They also have difficulty waking in the morning. About a third of people who get recurrent winter depression become overactive and over-cheerful in the spring and summer.</p>
