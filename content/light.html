  <h1 id="light">Light</h1>
  <p>The Heliotrope lightscape was devised and choreographed by Adrian Stewart and Judith Wylie Macleod of <a href="http://www.do-architecture.co.uk">DO Architecture</a>. It is twelve minutes long, and reflects a journey from the darkness of winter into the bright warmth of summer. Shifting the colour temperature of white light simulates the nuance between varying seasons.</p>
  <p>Intelligent control of the luminaires permits variation of intensity and colour temperature from warm (2700K) to cool (6500K). They are normally used for architectural purposes: to light cityscapes, landscapes, buildings or bridges.</p>
