# About

How does light affect us? How do we feel the seasons? What is our relationship with the sun? What happens to us during the winter months when we see less of it?

Heliotrope has three parts to it: a 12 minute audio and light installation, this website and a beautiful limited edition booklet. It has been created by a team of artists, designers and scientists, working together to explore the impact of light on human minds and bodies.

> "As a human experience it stands out. Its artistic nature facilitates a very personal experience."\
> Audience member: Heliotrope tests, June 2012.

The installation happened at the Kibble Palace in Glasgow's Botanic Gardens from 24 to 27 November 2012.
