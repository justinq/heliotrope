# Audio

Hanna Tuulikki's soundtrack has been created from a series of singing bowl and gong samples. In early 2012, Hanna visited sound therapist Helen Johnson who has been exploring the use of singing bowls in a therapeutic setting since the 1980s.  Working with musician Daniel Padden she recorded samples of a number of differently sized bowls, as well as various gongs.  She then used these to develop a twelve minute composition: an audio narrative that takes us on a journey from the darkness of winter towards the brightness of summer.

The soundscape is a surround sound piece, and appears to emerge from all directions when experienced as part of Heliotrope. It will be available to listen to online in mid-November.

<!-- TODO: For inclusion when iteration 2 goes live.
Some of the samples that Hanna has been working with are embedded in this website. If you close this window, you can choose to switch to the audio version of the site. This will let you 'play' the planets drifting around the Heliotrope sun. -->
