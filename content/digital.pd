We have created this website as a parallel way of experiencing Heliotrope. It explores the same themes as the physical installation in a way that we hope is sensitive to and appropriate for online viewing.

Created by Justin Quillinan and Stefanie Posavec, the website communicates seasonal shifts in mood. Appearance changes throughout the day, reflecting the way our emotional state can change in response to the seasons. If you're looking at this during daytime hours, you'll encounter a representation of summer moods: warmth, happiness, bright colours and fast movements. If it's the night wherever you are, you'll encounter a version of winter moods: darker, more subdued, cooler colours, slower movement.

All through the day the mood of the website changes: from a summer day to a winter night and evolving through the spring and autumn twilight hours between.
