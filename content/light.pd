# Light

The Heliotrope lightscape was devised and choreographed by Adrian Stewart and Judith Wylie Macleod of [DO Architecture](http://www.do-architecture.co.uk). It is twelve minutes long, and reflects a journey from the darkness of winter into the bright warmth of summer.  Shifting the colour temperature of white light simulates the nuance between varying seasons.

Intelligent control of the luminaires permits variation of intensity and colour temperature from warm (2700K) to cool (6500K).  They are normally used for architectural purposes: to light cityscapes, landscapes, buildings or bridges.
