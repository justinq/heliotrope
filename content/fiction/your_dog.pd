## Your Dog

The dog yawns on the end of the bed.\
Stinking up the place.\
I try and tell you how when I was young\
I never took to swimming.\
The dog interrupts me by \
barking along to The Archers theme-tune\
and standing in the toast.\

The dog is yours\
and what is yours is sort of mine\
and if it left, you would be better.\
There'd be something close to sunshine.\

Autumn promises firework displays.\
For you it whispers darker days\
in the mornings all that seeps inside is grey\
your flat looks out on nothing much.\
It faces the wrong way.\

I leave you in your place and I go home.\
Catch a glimpse of canine silhouette,\
black, at the window as I go.\
Gooseberry dog, your paws are dirty\
and I wish you'd go for sticks.\
I'd lob one over rooftops\
so he and me could be alone.\
