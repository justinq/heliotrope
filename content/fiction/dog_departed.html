  <h2 id="dog-departed">Dog Departed</h2>
  <p>One day you wake up and the dog is gone.<br />Nothing pulls your arm as you walk,<br />no sticky residue left from balling fist in fur<br />and in the pub, you begin to ask<br />if the dog can come in, before remembering<br />that the dog is no longer a thing.<br /> Your hands are quicker.<br />Your t-shirts are cleaner<br />and the way you speak:<br />you mean what you say more.<br />You lose yourself in April.<br />Things look much more floral.<br />The dent at the end of your bed<br />begins flattening and your feet start forgetting.<br />You're less like a chrysalis<br />more like a moth.<br />Your voice has a flippancy that makes you feel<br />that you are fall-in-lovable.<br /> Through the lighter months you don't forget entirely<br />but the heart-sink fades<br />and the shoulder-pull feeling doesn't stay.<br />By July you don't even remember the dog's name<br />and you stop wondering when it's coming back.<br />You smile at dog walkers in the park<br />and fellow black dog owners<br />you forgot to make friends with in the dark.<br /> You vow to be nicer to them next winter<br />and you hope their dogs have left them too.<br />You feel closer to everyone as the chorus begins,<br />as you walk home the long way in the last of the night.<br />Some of us were in a darker place to begin with<br />but we are, all of us, searching for the light.<br /></p>
