## Domestic Dog

Your friend the artist owns a black dog\
and talks about how she cannot paint without it.\
You work in a Building Society\
and sit next to a man who smells of Horlicks\
and your black dog\
is a mangy sheep.\
A three-legged camel\
a poorly gibbon\
a braying goose\
a dead cow.\
What I'm saying is, \
you could do without this now.\
Feeding it is becoming a problem.\
Hiding it from clients makes you tired.\
Getting it through the barrier at Clapham Junction\
when you go home for Christmas\
is going to be a nightmare.\

You try and persuade the dog\
not to come to work tomorrow\
as the two of you watch\
black and white movies of an evening.\
In old films, sorrow looks more romantic than this.\
There are fewer animals for one\
and smoking wasn't bad for you then.\
