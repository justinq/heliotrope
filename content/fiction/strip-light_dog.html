  <p>This could be Glasgow, or Tokyo<br />either way I want to crawl inside its neon<br />and hibernate in glow.<br />The black dog joins me for coffee<br />at a diner on a street of diners.<br />We watch the traffic splashing puddles<br />onto bicycle-clipped nylon trousers.<br />I don't know what time it is,<br />the clocks went back, or forward,<br />for farmers, for the mornings.<br /> I order a sandwich with extra bread.<br />The dog has a skinny latte.<br />I want to be the sort of person who makes demands,<br />who asks, what are you doing here?<br />And, how long will this last?<br />But the dog's proximity is soporific.<br />Makes me the kind of person who leaves too big a tip<br />for the service I haven't received.<br />We stare out at diminishing tail lights<br />the dog's black, unnerving eyes which seem to say<br />I'm here to stay.<br /></p>
