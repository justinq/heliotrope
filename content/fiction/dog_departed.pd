## Dog Departed

One day you wake up and the dog is gone.\
Nothing pulls your arm as you walk,\
no sticky residue left from balling fist in fur\
and in the pub, you begin to ask\
if the dog can come in, before remembering\
that the dog is no longer a thing.\

Your hands are quicker.\
Your t-shirts are cleaner\
and the way you speak:\
you mean what you say more.\
You lose yourself in April.\
Things look much more floral.\
The dent at the end of your bed\
begins flattening and your feet start forgetting.\
You're less like a chrysalis\
more like a moth.\
Your voice has a flippancy that makes you feel\
that you are fall-in-lovable.\

Through the lighter months you don't forget entirely\
but the heart-sink fades\
and the shoulder-pull feeling doesn't stay.\
By July you don't even remember the dog's name\
and you stop wondering when it's coming back.\
You smile at dog walkers in the park\
and fellow black dog owners\
you forgot to make friends with in the dark.\

You vow to be nicer to them next winter\
and you hope their dogs have left them too.\
You feel closer to everyone as the chorus begins,\
as you walk home the long way in the last of the night.\
Some of us were in a darker place to begin with\
but we are, all of us, searching for the light.\
