  <p>Your friend the artist owns a black dog<br />and talks about how she cannot paint without it.<br />You work in a Building Society<br />and sit next to a man who smells of Horlicks<br />and your black dog<br />is a mangy sheep.<br />A three-legged camel<br />a poorly gibbon<br />a braying goose<br />a dead cow.<br />What I'm saying is,<br />you could do without this now.<br />Feeding it is becoming a problem.<br />Hiding it from clients makes you tired.<br />Getting it through the barrier at Clapham Junction<br />when you go home for Christmas<br />is going to be a nightmare.<br /> You try and persuade the dog<br />not to come to work tomorrow<br />as the two of you watch<br />black and white movies of an evening.<br />In old films, sorrow looks more romantic than this.<br />There are fewer animals for one<br />and smoking wasn't bad for you then.<br /></p>
