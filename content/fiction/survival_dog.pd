## Survival Dog

Inside a cave\
a dog is a useful commodity.\
Thick black fur is convenient.\
A hand plunged into a shaggy coat\
makes a fist and squeezes.\
Here, you are a friend with a looming frame\
a bounding energy in a dark place\
a buddy even when you are sleeping.\

The opposite of you is blacker than you.\
We need each other here,\
food is scarce and your body is warm\
we sigh and wait for dawn\
a silk jet chorus of comfort.\

Breakfast is gathered under stars.\
Stars have long since sputtered out.\
All this has already happened.\
Before we invented buildings.\
