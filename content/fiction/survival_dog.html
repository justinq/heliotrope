  <p>Inside a cave<br />a dog is a useful commodity.<br />Thick black fur is convenient.<br />A hand plunged into a shaggy coat<br />makes a fist and squeezes.<br />Here, you are a friend with a looming frame<br />a bounding energy in a dark place<br />a buddy even when you are sleeping.<br /> The opposite of you is blacker than you.<br />We need each other here,<br />food is scarce and your body is warm<br />we sigh and wait for dawn<br />a silk jet chorus of comfort.<br /> Breakfast is gathered under stars.<br />Stars have long since sputtered out.<br />All this has already happened.<br />Before we invented buildings.<br /></p>
