  <p>The dog yawns on the end of the bed.<br />Stinking up the place.<br />I try and tell you how when I was young<br />I never took to swimming.<br />The dog interrupts me by<br />barking along to The Archers theme-tune<br />and standing in the toast.<br /> The dog is yours<br />and what is yours is sort of mine<br />and if it left, you would be better.<br />There'd be something close to sunshine.<br /> Autumn promises firework displays.<br />For you it whispers darker days<br />in the mornings all that seeps inside is grey<br />your flat looks out on nothing much.<br />It faces the wrong way.<br /> I leave you in your place and I go home.<br />Catch a glimpse of canine silhouette,<br />black, at the window as I go.<br />Gooseberry dog, your paws are dirty<br />and I wish you'd go for sticks.<br />I'd lob one over rooftops<br />so he and me could be alone.<br /></p>
