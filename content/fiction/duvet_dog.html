  <p>She ignores the text message invitation.<br />Of course she doesn't fancy a game of ultimate frisbee.<br />It's January and she's got stuff to do.<br />This indoor tent won't pitch itself.<br /> She pulls duvets, blankets, cushions under canvas<br />stuffs to-do lists to the bottom of her sleeping bag.<br />The prospect of the doorbell snags her heart<br />let alone the idea of the way winter might feel.<br />She angles the TV so she can see it through the flaps<br />sleeps spooning the remote.<br /> A crack in the curtains reveals a bright white morning.<br />The thought of pulling them back startles her<br />almost makes her get up.<br />But in the end she grasps at sunken comfort.<br />Crawls inside layers.<br />She is not alone.<br />The black dog is here.<br />A gloomy panting presence,<br />aiding in her forgetting the things that help<br />distracting her from life-lines with warm growls.<br /></p>
