## Strip-light Dog

This could be Glasgow, or Tokyo\
either way I want to crawl inside its neon\
and hibernate in glow.\
The black dog joins me for coffee\
at a diner on a street of diners.\
We watch the traffic splashing puddles\
onto bicycle-clipped nylon trousers.\
I don't know what time it is,\
the clocks went back, or forward,\
for farmers, for the mornings.\

I order a sandwich with extra bread.\
The dog has a skinny latte.\
I want to be the sort of person who makes demands,\
who asks, what are you doing here?\
And, how long will this last?\
But the dog's proximity is soporific.\
Makes me the kind of person who leaves too big a tip\
for the service I haven't received.\
We stare out at diminishing tail lights\
the dog's black, unnerving eyes which seem to say\
I'm here to stay.\
