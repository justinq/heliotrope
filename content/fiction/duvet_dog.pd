## Duvet Dog

She ignores the text message invitation.\
Of course she doesn't fancy a game of ultimate frisbee.\
It's January and she's got stuff to do.\
This indoor tent won't pitch itself.\

She pulls duvets, blankets, cushions under canvas\
stuffs to-do lists to the bottom of her sleeping bag.\
The prospect of the doorbell snags her heart\
let alone the idea of the way winter might feel.\
She angles the TV so she can see it through the flaps\
sleeps spooning the remote.\

A crack in the curtains reveals a bright white morning.\
The thought of pulling them back startles her\
almost makes her get up.\
But in the end she grasps at sunken comfort.\
Crawls inside layers.\
She is not alone.\
The black dog is here.\
A gloomy panting presence,\
aiding in her forgetting the things that help\
distracting her from life-lines with warm growls.\
